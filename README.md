EVLib Scalability Test

This project seeks to perform a scalability test on the EVLib library, found here: https://github.com/skarapost/EVLib. The overall objective is to determine how useful the objects and tools provided by EVLib are when subjected to large-scale simulations, particularly of multiple charging stations within a single city.
